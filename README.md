# go-tcp-balancer

A small TCP load balancer written in Go based on:

https://github.com/lumanetworks/go-tcp-proxy

## Note

This load balancer is NOT made for balancing many connections (for instance
hundreds or thousands a second) but is meant for relatively few connections
like SSH connections which create a lot of load (because the users start
tasks).

Where I worked, this program was used for "all purpose" compute servers to run
MATLAB jobs or run some compiled C code. 
It is in use at a University to distribute clients to the server with the
lowest load.

# Setup
If you move this project to some other location in the file system you must
update the init scripts so they start properly.

The PWD of the process needs to be in the same dir as the PHP script!

# Load balance strategies
The load balancer knows two strategies to forward clients.

## By lowest load
For this to work you need `nrpe` client installed.
`nrpe` is the client used by nagios.

The load balancer then runs the nrpe command `check_load` which must be
configured like this in `nrpe.cfg`:

    command[check_load]=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_load -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$

This will return the one minute load and forward the client to the server that
still has the most load free.

Ie, given:

* 24 core machine and load 15 
* 12 core machine and load 8

the algorithm would still choose the 24 core machine even though it has a
higher load.
This is because the server has still more resources available than the 12 core
server.

RAM is not taken into account but it would not be difficult to do so.

## Round robin
If no server has load information then round robin strategy kicks in.

# upstart scripts
Upstart scripts are in `scripts` subdirectory.
